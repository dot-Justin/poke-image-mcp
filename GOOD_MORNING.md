npm start
```

### 3. Test with Inspector
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx tsx src/index.ts
```
Then try:
- Click "list_images" tool
- Click "get_image" tool, enter filename: "test.jpg"
- Click "get_image_info" tool, enter filename: "test.jpg"

### 4. Connect to Claude Desktop
1. Copy `claude_desktop_config.example.json` settings
2. Update path to your actual path
3. Add to your Claude Desktop config
4. Restart Claude Desktop
5. Ask Claude: "List all available images"

## 🎨 Example Usage

Once connected to Claude Desktop:

**"List all available images"**
→ Shows test.jpg with size

**"Show me test.jpg"**
→ Displays the image

**"What are the dimensions of test.jpg?"**
→ Shows detailed technical info

**"Convert test.jpg to WebP with 85% quality"**
→ Returns converted image
